## Materials Needed

*   [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)
*   [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/)
> *   [Slides](https://rawgit.com/wptrainingteam/repo-name/dev/slides/index.html) (included in this repo)

## Notes for the Instructor

*   Ahead of the lesson, make sure you take a look at your own computer setup. If you have MAMP or MAMP Pro already installed on your machine, you may want to run this demo on a virtual box to avoid conflicts with existing software and local sites that you may want to keep on your machine.
*   Sometimes it can take a while to download large files like MAMP or WordPress core. You may want to have a copy of MAMP and the current version of WordPress downloaded and stored on a thumb drive that can be passed around the class before you start the lesson. In the context of the demo, you would still show where to download these files, but would skip the actual live download.
*   MAMP is updated quite often. Please be sure to walk through the lesson plan with a fresh install to be sure it is still up to date.

## Have You Thought About...?

## Example Lesson

<span style="color: #000000">In order to run WordPress locally, you need to have a server. In this lesson, you will learn to set up a server, create a database and install WordPress on your computer.</span>

### <span style="color: #000000">Install MAMP</span>

<span style="color: #000000">MAMP stands for My Apache, MySQL, and PHP. MAMP is an application you can install on your Mac or Windows PC that allows you to have access to a local server that is running PHP and MySQL. Essentially, MAMP gives you all of the tools you need to run WordPress on your machine, for development and testing purposes.</span> <span style="color: #000000">To install MAMP, go to [https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/). Download the version of MAMP that corresponds with your machine (Mac OS X or Windows). Double click on the downloaded file. This will open the installation dialog. Next we'll follow the prompts in the dialog to complete installation. This course uses the default settings recommended by the install dialog.</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 2.18.07 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.18.07-PM-300x188.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.18.07-PM.png)</span>

### <span style="color: #000000">Open and configure MAMP</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Now that MAMP is installed, let's open it up! MAMP has a button to start servers when first started. By clicking on "Preferences" you can select an option to start the Apache HTTP Server and MySQL database server upon starting MAMP.</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 2.30.41 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.30.41-PM-300x229.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.30.41-PM.png)</span> <span style="color: #000000">Click on the "preferences" icon. You'll see that there are <del>four</del> five tabbed menu items available.</span> <span style="color: #000000">Click the "Web Server" tab and find the "Document Root." This path is where MAMP expects to find the files associated with your local website. In this case, this is where the WordPress files will need to be located in order to run them on the server. You may change this directory to whatever you want. The default is "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs" on a Mac and "C:/MAMP" on Windows. [![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 2.45.14 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.45.14-PM-300x230.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.45.14-PM.png)</span>

### <span style="color: #000000">Set up a Database</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Next, we will create a database on your new MAMP server. This database will become the database for the locally installed WordPress site.</span> <span style="color: #000000">Go back to the MAMP dialog and click "Open WebStart page."</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![MAMP4](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/MAMP4-1024x471.jpg)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/MAMP4.jpg) [](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.52.37-PM.png) </span> <span style="color: #000000">Using the menu bar at the top of the page, click "Tools -> phpMyAdmin."</span> <span style="color: #000000">The phpMyAdmin dialog will appear: [![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 3.12.15 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.12.15-PM-1024x514.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.12.15-PM.png)</span> <span style="color: #000000">Click the "New" link in the left menu sidebar.</span> <span style="color: #000000">In the following dialog, use the name "mydatabase" to name the database:[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 3.12.52 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.12.52-PM-1024x560.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.12.52-PM.png)</span> <span style="color: #000000">Leave the "Collation" option as default.</span> <span style="color: #000000">You now have a database called "mydatabase." Congratulations!</span>

### <span style="color: #000000">Install WordPress</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Now we're ready to install WordPress on our local machine! Go to [https://wordpress.org/download/](https://wordpress.org/download/) to download the most recent version of WordPress. Once you download and copy the WordPress files to your computer, you will be able to install WordPress using the traditional 5 Minute Install.</span> <span style="color: #000000">Move the downloaded zip file to the default server directory, "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs." You could expand the zip file in your downloads folder and move the expanded folder and it's contents, but sometimes the "hidden" system files that are included in WordPress (like the .htaccess file) fail to copy over to new folders if the contents are unzipped. For that reason, we'll leave our zip file zipped while we're moving it.</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 3.24.02 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.02-PM-300x99.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.02-PM.png)</span> <span style="color: #000000">In the new"/Applications/MAMP/htdocs" location, double click the WordPress zip file and it will expand.</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 3.24.28 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.28-PM-300x84.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.28-PM.png)</span> <span style="color: #000000">Go back to your web browser, and in the black menu bar, click the link "My Website."[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 2.52.37 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.52.37-PM-300x188.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-2.52.37-PM.png)The link will take you to a list of websites installed in the directory:</span> <span style="color: #000000">[![Screen Shot 2016-01-21 at 3.24.53 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.53-PM-300x175.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-01-21-at-3.24.53-PM.png)Click the "wordpress" link.
